        <p>Hello, this is my website. You will soon find some of my
        <strong>programming projects</strong> and... that's all for now.</p>

            <h2>What I am currently working on</h2>
            <p>I am writing an i386 <strong>compiler</strong> for a brand new
            programming language. The source code is not yet public and this is
            not a serious project - it is more of a hobby thing. The generated
            assembly output is meant to be fed to GNU as.</p>

            <h2>Why this website has no styling</h2>
            <p>Unfortunately, the World Wide Web standards are a mess.
            Web browsers allows the user to select custom fonts and text size.
            To improve compatibility with these settings, this website does
            not force any styling on the user.</p>
